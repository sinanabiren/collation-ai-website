## Core Product: AI-Powered Wealth Aggregation & Analytics Platform

### What We Do
Collation AI enables comprehensive wealth portfolio aggregation and analysis across multiple banks, custodians, and asset classes. We transform fragmented financial data into actionable insights for investors, advisors, and financial institutions.

## Use Case #1: Account Aggregation

### The Problems We Solve

**For Investors:**
- Complex assets with siloed data across multiple institutions
- Multiple logins and cumbersome access to different accounts
- Time-consuming manual data entry
- Lack of readily customizable reports
- No holistic view of total wealth

**For Financial Advisors & Banks:**
- Lack of competitive intelligence (clients' assets at other banks)
- Time-intensive preparation for client meetings
- Revenue pressure and difficulty increasing wallet share
- Making decisions with only 33% visibility (when clients have 3 banks)
- Inability to demonstrate value vs. competitors

### Our Solution: Hyper-Personalized Analysis from Any Data Source

**Data Aggregation Methodology** (4-step waterfall approach):

**Step 1:** Find if datafeeds/APIs are available
- Bank datafeeds
- Bank APIs
- Direct feeds from custodians

**Step 2:** If datafeed unavailable, look for other API providers
- Yodlee
- Quovo
- Tink
- Other aggregation services

**Step 3:** Use PDF/XLS statements (Our Specialty!)
- Monthly PDF statements
- Excel reports
- Automated extraction using proprietary AI

**Step 4:** Paper statements
- Physical document processing
- Required by law, always available as fallback

### For Investors: Become an Intelligent Investor

1. **Save time on manual data entry** - Automated data aggregation
2. **View consolidated portfolio** - All assets in one place
3. **Understand what's working** - Performance analysis across all accounts
4. **Compare to peers** - Benchmark against similar investors
5. **Download portfolio summary reports** - Professional reporting
6. **Align portfolio with goals** - Goal-based planning tools
7. **Result:** Become an Intelligent Investor with complete visibility

**Key Benefits:**

### For Financial Advisors: Become a Trusted Advisor

**How Collation AI Helps Advisors:**
1. **Competitive Intelligence** - See what clients hold at other banks
2. **Strengthen Trust** - Demonstrate holistic understanding
3. **Holistic Understanding** - Complete view of client's total wealth
4. **Control the Conversation** - Lead with data-driven insights
5. **Retain Clients from Other Banks** - Show superior performance
6. **Increase Wallet Share** - Identify opportunities to win assets
7. **Upsell and Cross-Sell** - Target products based on complete picture

**The Aggregation Advantage in Mature Markets:**

**RM Potential Index:**
- Identifies relationship managers with clients who have significant "held away" assets
- Shows performance comparison between your bank and competitors
- Highlights opportunities where competitors are underperforming
- Prioritizes RMs for targeted campaigns to win assets

**Example Insight:**
- RM1 has clients with $130M held away at other banks
- Those assets are performing at just above 0%
- If your bank's average performance is 5%, it's an easy conversation to move those assets

**Private Bank vs. Non-Professional Management:**
- Analysis shows professionally managed assets (Private Banks) outperform "not professionally managed" assets
- Non-professionally managed assets represent 71.57% of total assets (significant opportunity)
- Performance gap creates compelling case for professional management

**Discretionary Portfolio Management (DPM) Benefits:**
- DPM accounts show similar returns to other accounts but with much lower volatility
- Provides data-driven evidence for recommending managed accounts
- Risk-adjusted return demonstration

### For Banks: Strategic Intelligence & Client Retention

**Aggregation is No Longer "Nice to Have" - It's a Strategic Choice:**

**Problem 1: Lack of Competitive Insights**
→ **Solution:** Assess clients' behavior with other banks and offer more competitive services

**Problem 2: Time-Intensive Preparation**
→ **Solution:** Consolidated accurate data and professional reports at your fingertips

**Problem 3: Revenue Pressure**
→ **Solution:** Analysis leads to better performance, strengthens trust, and increases wallet share

### Real-World Implementation: UBS Use Case

**Data Flow:**
1. **Client signs bilateral contract** with Collation AI (bank is not party)
2. **Client instructs UBS** to send data to Collation AI
3. **Daily datafeed** from UBS to client's Collation AI platform
4. **Client instructs other banks** (Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Julius Baer, BNP Paribas, etc.) to share data
5. **RMs at other banks share monthly PDFs**
6. **Client uploads non-bankable assets** (PE, RE, Art, etc.)

**Who Gets Access:**
- **High Net Worth Client:** Complete portfolio view across all institutions
- **UBS Management:** Metadata on customers, competition, and own team
- **UBS Client Advisor:** Tactical/competitive data on UBS portfolio AND other banks
- **Other Bank Advisors:** NO ACCESS (data privacy protected)

**Results:**
- High-quality, multi-bank, multi-asset class, multi-currency reporting
- Competitive intelligence for the bank
- Enhanced client engagement
- Increased wallet share opportunities

## Use Case #2: Big Data Mining & Stimulating Client Action

### The Login Problem

**Challenge:**
- Low login rates to financial websites (task-oriented only)
- Markets are time-sensitive (insights have short shelf life)
- Probability of clients seeing relevant insights on website ≈ zero
- 80/20 problem: 80% of revenue from 20% of clients - what about the remaining 80%?

**Solution: Multi-Channel Engagement**
Best results from combining:
1. **Personalized Emails** (Primary channel)
2. **Client Advisor interactions** (Human touch)
3. **Website/Portal** (On-demand access)

### Personalized and Targeted Emails

**Proven Results:**
- Close to **100% open rates**
- **Multiple email opens** (forwarded to family, advisors, etc.)
- **Clients taking action** (reaching out for more details)
- **Clients requesting more** (best indicator of success)

**Email Content Examples:**
- Performance comparison to peer group
- Geography concentration by market value
- Asset class breakdown comparisons

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What makes Collation AI different from other aggregation solutions?**
A: Our proprietary AI technology can extract data from any source, including complex PDF statements that other platforms can't handle. We're built by the team that managed $170B in assets at Canopy, with 100,000+ training documents perfecting our AI.

**Q: How do you handle data security?**
A: We're ISO 27001 certified with SOC 2 compliance in progress. We use an anonymous platform approach and recommend removing PII from statements. Everything runs on Microsoft's enterprise-grade technology stack.

**Q: Can you really process PDF statements accurately?**
A: Yes! This is our specialty. Our AI has been trained on 100,000+ documents and millions of transactions. We can process statements from any bank worldwide, even complex multi-page reports.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: Typical implementation is 2-4 weeks for initial setup, with full deployment in 1-3 months depending on the number of data sources and customization requirements.

**Q: Do clients need to give banks their login credentials?**
A: No. Clients instruct their banks directly to send data to Collation AI. We never ask for or store login credentials. The client signs a bilateral contract with us, and banks send data on the client's direct instruction.

**Q: Can advisors see my clients' assets at other banks?**
A: Only if the client explicitly authorizes it. By default, each client's data is private. If a client wants their advisor to see aggregated data from other banks, they must provide that permission.

**Q: What types of assets can you aggregate?**
A: We handle all asset classes: equities, bonds, funds, derivatives, cash, loans, real estate, private equity, art, insurance, and more. If it's on a statement or in a spreadsheet, we can process it.

**Q: How does the RM Potential Index work?**
A: It analyzes clients' held-away assets and their performance at other banks, then identifies which relationship managers have the best opportunities to win those assets based on performance gaps and asset size.

**Q: What's the typical ROI for banks using Collation AI?**
A: Banks report increased wallet share, improved client retention, and significant time savings for relationship managers. The competitive intelligence alone often pays for the platform by identifying specific opportunities to win assets.

**Q: Do you work with Family Offices?**
A: Yes, we work extensively with family offices, RIAs, and wealth managers. Our platform is ideal for complex multi-generational wealth structures with assets across multiple banks and countries.
